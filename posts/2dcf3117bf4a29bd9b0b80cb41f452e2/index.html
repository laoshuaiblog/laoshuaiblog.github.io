                    <p>Written by Christopher E. Strangio<br>Copyright &amp;copy; 1993-2004 by CAMI Research Inc., Lexington, Massachusetts<br>(RSR232 renamed the "EIA232 Standard" in the early 1990's)</p> 
<p><br>What is EIA232?</p> 
<p><br>In the early 1960s, a standards committee, today known as the Electronic Indus<br>tries Association, developed a common interface standard for data communicatio<br>ns equipment. At that time, data communications was thought to mean digital da<br>ta exchange between a centrally located mainframe computer and a remote comput<br>er terminal, or possibly between two terminals without a computer involved. Th<br>ese devices were linked by telephone voice lines, and consequently required a<br>modem at each end for signal translation. While simple in concept, the many op<br>portunities for data error that occur when transmitting data through an analog<br> channel require a relatively complex design. It was thought that a standard w<br>as needed first to ensure reliable communication, and second to enable the int<br>erconnection of equipment produced by different manufacturers, thereby fosteri<br>ng the benefits of mass production and competition. From these ideas, the RS23<br>2 standard was born. It specified signal voltages, signal timing, signal function<br>n<br>tors.</p> 
<p>Over the 40+ years since this standard was developed, the Electronic Industrie<br>s Association published three modifications, the most recent being the EIA232E<br> standard introduced in 1991. Besides changing the name from RS232 to EIA232,<br>some signal lines were renamed and various new ones were defined, including a<br>shield conductor.</p> 
<p><br>Likely Problems when Using an EIA232 Interface</p> 
<p><br>During this 40-year-long, rapidly evolving period in electronics, manufacturer<br>s adopted simplified versions of this interface for applications that were imp<br>ossible to envision in the 1960s. Today, virtually all contemporary serial int<br>erfaces are EIA232-like in their signal voltages, protocols, and connectors, w<br>hether or not a modem is involved. Because no single "simplified" standard was<br> agreed upon, however, many slightly different protocols and cables were creat<br>ed that obligingly mate with any EIA232 connector, but are incompatible with e<br>ach other. Most of the difficulties you will encounter in EIA232 interfacing i<br>nclude at least one of the following:</p> 
<p>1 - The absence or misconnection of flow control (handshaking) signals, result<br>ing in buffer overflow or communications lock-up.</p> 
<p>2 - Incorrect communications function (DTE versus DCE) for the cable in use, r<br>esulting in the reversal of the Transmit and Receive data lines as well as one<br> or more handshaking lines.</p> 
<p>3 - Incorrect connector gender or pin configuration, preventing cable connecto<br>rs from mating properly.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, EIA232 driver circuitry is highly tolerant of misconnections, and<br> will usually survive a drive signal being connected to ground, or two drive s<br>ignals connected to each other. In any case, if the serial interface between t<br>wo devices is not operating correctly, disconnect the cable joining this equip<br>ment until the problem is isolated.</p> 
<p><br>Pin Assignments</p> 
<p>Go to DTE Pinout (looking into the computer's serial connector)<br>Go to DCE Pinout (looking into the modem's serial connector)</p> 
<p><br>If the full EIA232 standard is implemented as defined, the equipment at the fa<br>r end of the connection is named the DTE device (Data Terminal Equipment, usua<br>lly a computer or terminal), has a male DB25 connector, and utilizes 22 of the<br> 25 available pins for signals or ground. Equipment at the near end of the con<br>nection (the telephone line interface) is named the DCE device (Data Circuit-t<br>erminating Equipment, usually a modem), has a female DB25 connector, and utili<br>zes the same 22 available pins for signals and ground. The cable linking DTE a<br>nd DCE devices is a parallel straight-through cable with no cross-overs or sel<br>f-connects in the connector hoods. If all devices exactly followed this standa<br>rd, all cables would be identical, and there would be no chance that an incorr<br>ectly wired cable could be used. This drawing shows the orientation and connec<br>tor types for DTE and DCE devices:</p>

<p><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Many of the 22 signal lines in the EIA232 standard pertain to connections wher<br>e the DCE device is a modem, and then are used only when the software protocol<br> employs them. For any DCE device that is not a modem, or when two DTE devices<br> are directly linked, far fewer signal lines are necessary.</p> 
<p>You may have noticed in the pinout drawings that there is a secondary channel<br>which includes a duplicate set of flow-control signals. This secondary channel<br> provides for management of the remote modem, enabling baud rates to be change<br>d on the fly, retransmission to be requested if a parity error is detected, an<br>d other control functions. This secondary channel, when used, is typically set<br> to operate at a very low baud rate in comparison with the primary channel to<br>ensure reliability in the control path. In addition, it may operate as either<br>a simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex channel, depending on the capabilities<br>of the modem.</p> 
<p>Transmitter and receiver timing signals (pins 15, 17, and 24) are used only fo<br>r a synchronous transmission protocol. For the standard asynchronous 8-bit pro<br>tocol, external timing signals are unnecessary.</p> 
<p>IMPORTANT: Signal names that imply a direction, such as Transmit Data and Rece<br>ive Data, are named from the point of view of the DTE device. If the EIA232 st<br>andard were strictly followed, these signals would have the same name for the<br>same pin number on the DCE side as well. Unfortunately, this is not done in pr<br>actice by most engineers, probably because no one can keep straight which side<br> is DTE and which is DCE. As a result, direction-sensitive signal names are ch<br>anged at the DCE side to reflect their drive direction at DCE. The following l<br>ist gives the conventional usage of signal names:</p>

<p>This shows a 9-pin DTE-to-DCE serial cable that would result if the EIA232 sta<br>ndard were strictly followed. All 9 pins plus shield are directly extended fro<br>m DB9 Female to DB9 Male. There are no crossovers or self-connects present. Us<br>e this cable to connect modems, printers, or any device that uses a DB9 connec<br>tor to a PC's serial port.</p> 
<p>This cable may also serve as an extension cable to increase the distance betwe<br>en a computer and serial device. Caution: do not exceed 25 feet separation bet<br>ween devices without a signal booster!</p>

<p><br>2 - DB9 Loopback Connector<br>Next Cable | Previous Cable || Next Topic</p> 
<p>A loopback connector usually consists of a connector without a cable and inclu<br>des internal wiring to reroute signals back to the sender. This DB9 female con<br>nector would attach to a DTE device such as a personal computer. When the comp<br>uter receives data, it will not know whether the signals it receives come from<br> a remote DCE device set to echo characters, or from a loopback connector. Use<br> loopback connectors to confirm proper operation of the computer's serial port<br>. Once confirmed, insert the serial cable you plan to use and attach the loopb<br>ack to the end of the serial cable to verify the cable.</p> 
<p>In this case, Transmit Data joins to Received Data, Request-to-Send joins to C<br>lear-to-Send, and DTE-Ready joins to DCE-Ready and Received Line Signal Detect<br>.</p>

<p>Use this female-to-female cable in any application where you wish to connect t<br>wo DTE devices (for example, two computers). A male-to-male equivalent of this<br> cable would be used to connect two DCE devices.</p> 
<p>The cable shown below is intended for RS232 asynchronous communications (most<br>PC-based systems). If you are using synchronous communications, the null modem<br> will have additional connections for timing signals, and a DB25 connector wou<br>ld be necessary.</p> 
<p>NOTE: Not all null modem cables connect handshaking lines the same way. In thi<br>s cable, Request-to-Send (RTS, pin 7) asserts the Carrier Detect (pin 1) on th<br>e same side and the Clear-to-Send (CTS, pin 8) on the other side of the cable.</p>

<p>Note that Pins 11 and 12 are not necessary for this null modem cable to work.<br>As is often the case, the manufacturer of equipment that uses this cable had a<br> proprietary application in mind. We show it here to emphasize that custom ser<br>ial cables may include connections for which no purpose is clear.</p> 
<p>IMPORTANT: This cable employs NO handshaking lines between devices. The handsh<br>ake signals on each side are artificially made to appear asserted by the use o<br>f self-connects on each side of the cable (for example, between pins 4 and 5).<br> Without hardware handshaking, you risk buffer overflow at one or both ends of<br> the transmission unless STX and ETX commands are inserted in the dataflow by<br>software.</p>

<p>This simplified null modem cable uses only Request-to-Send (pin 4) and Clear-t<br>o-Send (pin 5) as handshaking lines; DTE Ready, DCE Ready, and Carrier Detect<br>are not employed, so this cable should not be used with modems.</p> 
<p>CAUTION! Normally, null modem cables have the same gender on each connector (e<br>ither both male for two DTE devices, or both female for two DCE devices). This<br> cable would be used when the gender on one of the devices does not conform to<br> the standard. However, the opposite genders imply usage as a straight through<br> cable, and if used in that manner will not function. Further, if used as a st<br>andard null-modem between two computers, the opposite gender allows you to con<br>nect one end to the parallel port, an impermissible situation that may cause h<br>ardware damage.</p>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Signal Definitions<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>Signal functions in the EIA232 standard can be subdivided into six categories.<br> These categories are summarized below, after which each signal described.</p> 
<p>1 - Signal ground and shield.</p> 
<p>2 - Primary communications channel. This is used for data interchange, and inc<br>ludes flow control signals.</p> 
<p>3 - Secondary communications channel. When implemented, this is used for contr<br>ol of the remote modem, requests for retransmission when errors occur, and gov<br>ernance over the setup of the primary channel.</p> 
<p>4 - Modem status and control signals. These signals indicate modem status and<br>provide intermediate checkpoints as the telephone voice channel is established<br>.</p> 
<p>5 - Transmitter and receiver timing signals. If a synchronous protocol is used<br>, these signals provide timing information for the transmitter and receiver, w<br>hich may operate at different baud rates.</p> 
<p>6 - Channel test signals. Before data is exchanged, the channel may be tested<br>for its integrity, and the baud rate automatically adjusted to the maximum rat<br>e that the channel can support.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Signal Ground and Shield<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>Pin 7, Pin 1, and the shell are included in this category. Cables provide sepa<br>rate paths for each, but internal wiring often connects pin 1 and the cable sh<br>ell/shield to signal ground on pin 7.</p> 
<p>Pin 7 - Ground All signals are referenced to a common ground, as defined by th<br>e voltage on pin 7. This conductor may or may not be connected to protective g<br>round inside the DCE device. The existence of a defined ground potential withi<br>n the cable makes the EIA232 standard different from a balanced differential v<br>oltage standard, such as EIA530, which provides far greater noise immunity.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Primary Communications Channel<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>Pin 2 - Transmitted Data (TxD) This signal is active when data is transmitted<br>from the DTE device to the DCE device. When no data is transmitted, the signal<br> is held in the mark condition (logic '1', negative voltage).</p> 
<p>NOTE: Pin 2 on the DCE device is commonly labeled "Received Data", although by<br> the EIA232 standard it should still be called Transmitted Data because the da<br>ta is thought to be destined for a remote DTE device.</p> 
<p><br>Pin 3 - Received Data (RxD) This signal is active when the DTE device receives<br> data from the DCE device. When no data is transmitted, the signal is held in<br>the mark condition (logic '1', negative voltage).</p> 
<p>NOTE: Pin 3 on the DCE device is commonly labeled "Transmitted Data", although<br> by the EIA232 standard it should still be called Received Data because the da<br>ta is thought to arrive from a remote DTE device.</p> 
<p><br>Pin 4 - Request to Send (RTS) This signal is asserted (logic '0', positive vol<br>tage) to prepare the DCE device for accepting transmitted data from the DTE de<br>vice. Such preparation might include enabling the receive circuits, or setting<br> up the channel direction in half-duplex applications. When the DCE is ready,<br>it acknowledges by asserting Clear to Send.</p> 
<p>NOTE: Pin 4 on the DCE device is commonly labeled "Clear to Send", although by<br> the EIA232 standard it should still be called Request to Send because the req<br>uest is thought to be destined for a remote DTE device.</p> 
<p><br>Pin 5 - Clear to Send (CTS) This signal is asserted (logic '0', positive volta<br>ge) by the DCE device to inform the DTE device that transmission may begin. RT<br>S and CTS are commonly used as handshaking signals to moderate the flow of dat<br>a into the DCE device.</p> 
<p>NOTE: Pin 5 on the DCE device is commonly labeled "Request to Send", although<br>by the EIA232 standard it should still be called Clear to Send because the sig<br>nal is thought to originate from a remote DTE device.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Secondary Communications Channel<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>Pin 14 - Secondary Transmitted Data (STxD)</p> 
<p>Pin 16 - Secondary Received Data (SRxD)</p> 
<p>Pin 19 - Secondary Request to Send (SRTS)</p> 
<p>Pin 13 - Secondary Clear to Send (SCTS)</p> 
<p>These signals are equivalent to the corresponding signals in the primary commu<br>nications channel. The baud rate, however, is typically much slower in the sec<br>ondary channel for increased reliability.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Modem Status and Control Signals<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>Pin 6 - DCE Ready (DSR) When originating from a modem, this signal is asserted<br> (logic '0', positive voltage) when the following three conditions are all sat<br>isfied:</p> 
<p>1 - The modem is connected to an active telephone line that is "off-hook";</p> 
<p>2 - The modem is in data mode, not voice or dialing mode; and</p> 
<p>3 - The modem has completed dialing or call setup functions and is generating<br>an answer tone.</p> 
<p><br>If the line goes "off-hook", a fault condition is detected, or a voice connect<br>ion is established, the DCE Ready signal is deasserted (logic '1', negative vo<br>ltage).</p> 
<p>IMPORTANT: If DCE Ready originates from a device other than a modem, it may be<br> asserted to indicate that the device is turned on and ready to function, or i<br>t may not be used at all. If unused, DCE Ready should be permanently asserted<br>(logic '0', positive voltage) within the DCE device or by use of a self-connec<br>t jumper in the cable. Alternatively, the DTE device may be programmed to igno<br>re this signal.</p> 
<p><br>Pin 20 - DTE Ready (DTR) This signal is asserted (logic '0', positive voltage)<br> by the DTE device when it wishes to open a communications channel. If the DCE<br> device is a modem, the assertion of DTE Ready prepares the modem to be connec<br>ted to the telephone circuit, and, once connected, maintains the connection. W<br>hen DTE Ready is deasserted (logic '1', negative voltage), the modem is switch<br>ed to "on-hook" to terminate the connection.</p> 
<p>IMPORTANT: If the DCE device is not a modem, it may require DTE Ready to be as<br>serted before the device can be used, or it may ignore DTE Ready altogether. I<br>f the DCE device (for example, a printer) is not responding, confirm that DTE<br>Ready is asserted before you search for other explanations.</p> 
<p><br>Pin 8 - Received Line Signal Detector (CD) (also called carrier detect) This s<br>ignal is relevant when the DCE device is a modem. It is asserted (logic '0', p<br>ositive voltage) by the modem when the telephone line is "off-hook", a connect<br>ion has been established, and an answer tone is being received from the remote<br> modem. The signal is deasserted when no answer tone is being received, or whe<br>n the answer tone is of inadequate quality to meet the local modem's requireme<br>nts (perhaps due to a noisy channel).</p> 
<p>Pin 12 - Secondary Received Line Signal Detector (SCD) This signal is equivale<br>nt to the Received Line Signal Detector (pin 8), but refers to the secondary c<br>hannel.</p> 
<p>Pin 22 - Ring Indicator (RI) This signal is relevant when the DCE device is a<br>modem, and is asserted (logic '0', positive voltage) when a ringing signal is<br>being received from the telephone line. The assertion time of this signal will<br> approximately equal the duration of the ring signal, and it will be deasserte<br>d between rings or when no ringing is present.</p> 
<p>Pin 23 - Data Signal Rate Selector This signal may originate either in the DTE<br> or DCE devices (but not both), and is used to select one of two prearranged b<br>aud rates. The asserted condition (logic '0', positive voltage) selects the hi<br>gher baud rate.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Transmitter and Receiver Timing Signals<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>Pin 15 - Transmitter Signal Element Timing (TC) (also called Transmitter Clock<br>) This signal is relevant only when the DCE device is a modem and is operating<br> with a synchronous protocol. The modem generates this clock signal to control<br> exactly the rate at which data is sent on Transmitted Data (pin 2) from the D<br>TE device to the DCE device. The logic '1' to logic '0' (negative voltage to p<br>ositive voltage) transition on this line causes a corresponding transition to<br>the next data element on the Transmitted Data line. The modem generates this s<br>ignal continuously, except when it is performing internal diagnostic functions<br>.</p> 
<p>Pin 17 - Receiver Signal Element Timing (RC) (also called Receiver Clock) This<br> signal is similar to TC described above, except that it provides timing infor<br>mation for the DTE receiver.</p> 
<p>Pin 24 - Transmitter Signal Element Timing (ETC) (also called External Transmi<br>tter Clock) Timing signals are provided by the DTE device for use by a modem.<br>This signal is used only when TC and RC (pins 15 and 17) are not in use. The l<br>ogic '1' to logic '0' transition (negative voltage to positive voltage) indica<br>tes the time-center of the data element. Timing signals will be provided whene<br>ver the DTE is turned on, regardless of other signal conditions.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Channel Test Signals<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>Pin 18 - Local Loopback (LL) This signal is generated by the DTE device and is<br> used to place the modem into a test state. When Local Loopback is asserted (l<br>ogic '0', positive voltage), the modem redirects its modulated output signal,<br>which is normally fed into the telephone line, back into its receive circuitry<br>. This enables data generated by the DTE to be echoed back through the local m<br>odem to check the condition of the modem circuitry. The modem asserts its Test<br> Mode signal on Pin 25 to acknowledge that it has been placed in local loopbac<br>k condition.</p> 
<p>Pin 21 - Remote Loopback (RL) This signal is generated by the DTE device and i<br>s used to place the remote modem into a test state. When Remote Loopback is as<br>serted (logic '0', positive voltage), the remote modem redirects its received<br>data back to its transmitted data input, thereby remodulating the received dat<br>a and returning it to its source. When the DTE initiates such a test, transmit<br>ted data is passed through the local modem, the telephone line, the remote mod<br>em, and back, to exercise the channel and confirm its integrity. The remote mo<br>dem signals the local modem to assert Test Mode on pin 25 when the remote loop<br>back test is underway.</p> 
<p>Pin 25 - Test Mode (TM) This signal is relevant only when the DCE device is a<br>modem. When asserted (logic '0', positive voltage), it indicates that the mode<br>m is in a Local Loopback or Remote Loopback condition. Other internal self-tes<br>t conditions may also cause Test Mode to be asserted, and depend on the modem<br>and the network to which it is attached.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Electrical Standards<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>The EIA232 standard uses negative, bipolar logic in which a negative voltage s<br>ignal represents logic '1', and positive voltage represents logic '0'. This pr<br>obably originated with the pre-RS232 current loop standard used in 1950s-vinta<br>ge teletype machines in which a flowing current (and hence a low voltage) repr<br>esents logic '1'. Be aware that the negative logic assignment of EIA232 is the<br> reverse of that found in most modern digital circuit designs. See the inside<br>rear cover of the CableEye manual for a comparison.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Common Signal Ground<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>The EIA232 standard includes a common ground reference on Pin 7, and is freque<br>ntly joined to Pin 1 and a circular shield that surrounds all 25 cable conduct<br>ors. Data, timing, and control signal voltages are measured with respect to th<br>is common ground. EIA232 cannot be used in applications where the equipment on<br> opposite ends of the connection must be electrically isolated.</p> 
<p>NOTE: optical isolators may be used to achieve ground isolation, however, this<br> option is not mentioned or included in the EIA232 specification.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Signal Characteristics<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>Equivalent Circuit - All signal lines, regardless of whether they provide data<br>, timing, or control information, may be represented by the electrical equival<br>ent circuit shown here:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>This is the equivalent circuit for an EIA232 signal line and applies to signal<br>s originating at either the DTE or DCE side of the connection. "Co" is not spe<br>cified in the standard, but is assumed to be small and to consist of parasitic<br> elements only. "Ro" and "Vo" are chosen so that the short-circuit current doe<br>s not exceed 500ma. The cable length is not specified in the standard; accepta<br>ble operation is experienced with cables that are less than 25 feet in length.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>Signal State Voltage Assignments - Voltages of -3v to -25v with respect to sig<br>nal ground (pin 7) are considered logic '1' (the marking condition), whereas v<br>oltages of +3v to +25v are considered logic '0' (the spacing condition). The r<br>ange of voltages between -3v and +3v is considered a transition region for whi<br>ch a signal state is not assigned.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>Logic states are assigned to the voltage ranges shown here. Note that this is<br>a "negative logic" convention, which is the reverse of that used in most moder<br>n digital designs.</p> 
<p>Most contemporary applications will show an open-circuit signal voltage of -8<br>to -14 volts for logic '1' (mark), and +8 to +14 volts for logic '0' (space).<br>Voltage magnitudes will be slightly less when the generator and receiver are c<br>onnected (when the DTE and DCE devices are connected with a cable).</p> 
<p>IMPORTANT: If you insert an LED signal tester in an EIA232 circuit to view sig<br>nal states, the signal voltage may drop in magnitude to very near the minimum<br>values of -3v for logic '1', and +3v for logic '0'. Also note that some inexpe<br>nsive EIA232 peripherals are powered directly from the signal lines to avoid u<br>sing a power supply of their own. Although this usually works without problems<br>, keep the cable short, and be aware that noise immunity will be reduced.</p> 
<p><br>Short-Circuit Tolerance - The generator is designed to withstand an open-circu<br>it (unconnected) condition, or short-circuit condition between its signal cond<br>uctor and any other signal conductor, including ground, without sustaining dam<br>age to itself or causing damage to any associated circuitry. The receiver is a<br>lso designed to accept any signal voltage within the range of ±25 volts witho<br>ut sustaining damage.</p> 
<p>CAUTION: Inductive loads or magnetically induced voltages resulting from long<br>cables may cause the received voltage to exceed the ±25-volt range momentaril<br>y during turn-on transients or other abnormal conditions, possibly causing dam<br>age to the generator, receiver, or both. Keep the cable length as short as pos<br>sible, and avoid running the cable near high-current switching loads like elec<br>tric motors or relays.</p> 
<p><br>Fail-Safe Signals - Four signals are intended to be fail-safe in that during p<br>ower-off or cable-disconnected conditions, they default to logic '1' (negative<br> voltage). They are:</p> 
<p>Request to Send - Default condition is deasserted.</p> 
<p>Sec. Request to Send - Default condition is deasserted.</p> 
<p>DTE Ready - Default condition is DTE not ready.</p> 
<p>DCE Ready - Default condition is DCE not ready.<br>Note specifically that if the cable is connected but the power is off in the g<br>enerator side, or if the cable is disconnected, there should be adequate bias<br>voltage in the receiver to keep the signal above +3v (logic '0') to ensure tha<br>t the fail-safe requirement is met.</p> 
<p>Schmitt triggers or other hysteresis devices may be used to enhance noise immu<br>nity in some designs, but should never be adjusted to compromise the fail-safe<br> requirement.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Signal Timing<br>Next Topic | Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>The EIA232 standard is applicable to data rates of up to 20,000 bits per secon<br>d (the usual upper limit is 19,200 baud). Fixed baud rates are not set by the<br>EIA232 standard. However, the commonly used values are 300, 1200, 2400, 9600,<br>and 19,200 baud. Other accepted values that are not often used are 110 (mechan<br>ical teletype machines), 600, and 4800 baud.</p> 
<p>Changes in signal state from logic '1' to logic '0' or vice versa must abide b<br>y several requirements, as follows:</p> 
<p>1 - Signals that enter the transition region during a change of state must mov<br>e through the transition region to the opposite signal state without reversing<br> direction or reentering.</p> 
<p>2 - For control signals, the transit time through the transition region should<br> be less than 1ms.</p> 
<p>3 - For Data and Timing signals, the transit time through the transition regio<br>n should be</p> 
<p>a - less than 1ms for bit periods greater than 25ms,</p> 
<p>b - 4% of the bit period for bit periods between 25ms and 125&amp;micro;s,</p> 
<p>c - less than 5&amp;micro;s for bit periods less than 125&amp;micro;s.<br>The rise and fall times of data and timing signals ideally should be equal, bu<br>t in any case vary by no more than a factor of three.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>An acceptable pulse (top) moves through the transition region quickly and with<br>out hesitation or reversal. Defective pulses (bottom) could cause data errors.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--</p> 
<p><br>4 - The slope of the rising and falling edges of a transition should not excee<br>d 30v/&amp;micro;S. Rates higher than this may induce crosstalk in adjacent conduc<br>tors of a cable.</p> 
<p><br>Note that neither the ASCII alphabet nor the asynchronous serial protocol that<br> defines the start bit, number of data bits, parity bit, and stop bit, is part<br> of the EIA232 specification. For your reference, it is discussed in the Data<br>Communications Basics section of this web site.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--<br>Accepted Simplifications of the Standard<br>Previous Topic | TOC</p> 
<p>The EIA232 document published by the Electronic Industries Association describ<br>es 14 permissible configurations of the original 22-signal standard. Each conf<br>iguration uses a subset of the 22 defined signals, and serves a more limited c<br>ommunications requirement than that suggested by using all the available 22-si<br>gnals. Applications for transmit-only, receive-only, half-duplex operation, an<br>d similar variations, are described. Unfortunately, connection to DCE devices<br>other than modems is not considered. Because many current serial interface app<br>lications involve direct device-to-device connections, manufacturers do not ha<br>ve a standard reference when producing printers, plotters, print spoolers, or<br>other common peripherals. Consequently, you must acquire the service manual fo<br>r each peripheral device purchased to determine exactly which signals are util<br>ized in its serial interface.</p>
